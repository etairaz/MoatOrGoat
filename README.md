# Moat or Goat 🐐🏰

A Swipe-based VC Investment Simulator.

> "I brought up the word 'moat' way too many times." - This Game's Origin Story

This fun little game was created after a session with some fine people from the **PEF group**, where I may or may not have caused people to have an overdose of the "moat" concept.

## The Game

You are a Venture Capitalist with **18 months of runway**.
Swipe through 100+ AI/Crypto/SaaS startup pitches:

-   **Swipe Right (🏰 MOAT)**: Defensible business. Strong network effects. You survive.
-   **Swipe Left (🐐 GOAT)**: Hype. Trash. Vaporware. You dodge a bullet.
-   **Pivot**: Skip a confusing pitch (Costs **2 Months** of runway).

**Goal**: Survive as long as possible and top the leaderboard.

## Tech Stack
-   React + Vite
-   Tailwind CSS (Vaporwave/Retro aesthetic)
-   Framer Motion (Swipe physics)
-   Supabase (Leaderboard)
